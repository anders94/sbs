known bugs:

  if you try to edit an event that is larger than the maximum int 
  number of seconds away in either direction from now( ), you will
  get a SQL exception in DBRoutines.getEvent( eventId ). you will 
  still be able to edit the event, but the date and time displayed
  will be now( ) rather than the event's date and time.
